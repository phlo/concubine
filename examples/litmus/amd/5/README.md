# Sequential Consistency

> [P.234](https://www.amd.com/system/files/TechDocs/24593.pdf#page=234)

Where sequential consistency is needed (for example in Dekkerâ€™s algorithm for mutual exclusion), an `FENCE` instruction should be used between the store and the subsequent load, or an atomic instruction, such as `CAS`, should be used for the store.

| Processor 0 | Processor 1 |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ADDI 1      | ADDI 1      |
| STORE 0     | STORE 1     |
| FENCE       | FENCE       |
| LOAD 1      | LOAD 0      |

* initially `[0] = [1] = 0`
* `accu_0 = accu_1 = 0` is not allowed

`LOAD 0` and `LOAD 1` cannot both read `0`.

| 1         | 5                 | 1       | 6     |
