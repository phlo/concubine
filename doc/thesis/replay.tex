\section{Replay}

In order to validate the correctness of our encodings, we included a \texttt{replay} \CHANGE{mode} for reevaluating the execution sequence of a given trace by the virtual machine used for simulation.
If a mismatch is found, it returns the first step in which the results start to differ and prints the corresponding states of both execution traces for comparison.
