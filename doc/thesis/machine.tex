\section{Machine Model}

% intro

% Our abstract machine model of a x86 multiprocessor system is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:machine:overview}.

%We will start by defining an abstract machine model of a multiprocessor system that allows stores to be reordered after loads.
%Since we are only concerned with the machine's behaviour as observed by assembly programs, the internal structure of any real processor's microarchitecture is a highly abstracted.
%To keep the state space of the resulting model checking problems as small as possible, we defined our model on the basis of a 16 bit, 1 register machine.

% consistent with amd/intel litmus tests

We will start by defining a \CHANGE{minimal virtual} machine model of a multiprocessor system as observed by assembly programs.

To keep the state space of the resulting model checking problems as small as possible, it is based on a 16 bit architecture, using only a minimal set of registers and a radically reduced instruction set.

\end{figure}

A schematic overview is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:machine:overview}, \CHANGE{where dashed lines depict components and data paths solely used by our \emph{compare and swap} mechanism}.
At the top of the figure are an arbitrary number of \CHANGE{logical} processors, each running a single \CHANGE{abstract} thread containing:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \ACCU: a single 16 bit accumulator register
  \item \MEM: a special purpose 16 bit register, storing the expected value required by a unary \emph{compare and swap} instruction
  % \item a \emph{store buffer} to break sequential consistency by delaying a single write, consisting of:
  \item a single element \emph{store buffer}, consisting of:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \SBFULL: a one bit flag register, signaling that it contains a value and may be flushed
      \item \SBADR: a 16 bit address register
      \item \SBVAL: a 16 bit value register
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

All \CHANGE{threads} are directly connected to the machine's shared memory, referred to as $\HEAP$, which will be uninitialized \CHANGE{unless any} eventual input data.
\CHANGE{Caches are abstracted as they don't influence
% our virtual machine's behaviour
the memory subsystem's basic behaviour
if they are coherent.}
In terms of memory ordering, the addition of a \emph{store buffer} allows stores to be reordered after loads, making our model consistent with Intel's or AMD's x86 memory ordering models \cite{ref:Intel, ref:AMD}.

% \todo[inline]{model based on interleaving the execution of instructions and store buffer flushes}

\subsection*{Scheduling}

At each step \CHANGE{in time} a \CHANGE{single thread} either executes an instruction or flushes its store buffer back to memory.
Scheduling is generally performed non-deterministically under the following constraints.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item A \CHANGE{thread} can execute a read, modify or control operation at any time.
  \item A \CHANGE{thread} can voluntarily flush its store buffer to memory only if it is full.
  \item A \CHANGE{thread} can execute a write or barrier operation only if its store buffer is empty.
  % \item \CHANGE{A thread can only execute an instruction if it is not suspended} %(by a previous \lstASM{CHECK} statement).}
  % \item \CHANGE{A thread cannot execute any more instructions if it has been stopped.} % by a \lstASM{HALT}.}
\end{enumerate}

\CHANGE{
We argue that this interleaving semantic is sufficient for simulating the effects of real hardware, due to the execution of instructions and store buffer flushes being seen as independent.
A similar argument applies regarding preemption, assuming the presence of at least as many physical processors as running threads.
Since preemptive operating system kernels contain memory barriers when switching contexts, our thread centric view remains valid
% as the architectural state remains the same and the move to another physical processor just manifests as a store buffer flush.
% and the switch to another processor
and preemption
is just hidden behind a store buffer flush.

\subsection*{Instructions}

Our machine uses a radically reduced instruction set that contains only the most substantial operations.
Instructions are stored separately for each thread and are therefore not contained in memory.
This abstraction allows the program counter to address instructions by their index, starting from zero.
To simplify the definition of operational semantics, instructions are labelled using the following attributes:

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{modify} -- Modifies a register's content.
  \item \textbf{read} -- Reads from memory using \emph{store forwarding}: if $\SBFULL$ is set and $\SBADR$ equals the given target address, the value contained in $\SBVAL$ is read instead of the corresponding shared memory location.
  \item \textbf{write} -- Writes to the store buffer by setting $\SBFULL$ to true, $\SBADR$ to the given target address and $\SBVAL$ to the value contained in $\ACCU$.
  \item \textbf{barrier} -- Blocks execution if the store buffer is full ($\SBFULL$ is set). %memory barrier% - requires the store buffer to be flushed
  \item \textbf{atomic} -- Multiple operations performed as a single, \CHANGE{indivisible} instruction.% (implies barrier)
  \item \textbf{control} -- Modifies the order in which instructions are executed.
\end{itemize}

Due to the single register architecture, all instructions have at most one operand.
The following list shall give an overview of our machine's instruction set.
